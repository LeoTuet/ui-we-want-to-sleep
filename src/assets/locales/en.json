    "firstParagraph": "Especially students who have to drive distances complain again and again that they have to get up absurdly early. Even if you live in Munich and rely on public transport (you don't want to be late at the slightest delay in the subway), 7:30 is insanely early.",
    "secondParagraph": "We advocate that the school starts at a later time, thus more in line with the biorhythms recommended by scientists.",
    "thirdParagraph": "A few years ago there was already a vote that confirmed the time; we want to find out if there is now a majority in favor of a later school start."
