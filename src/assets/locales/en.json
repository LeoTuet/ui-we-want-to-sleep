    "firstParagraph": "Especially students who have to drive distances complain again and again that they have to get up absurdly early. Even if you live in Munich and rely on public transport (you don't want to be late at the slightest delay in the subway), 7:30 is insanely early.",
    "secondParagraph": "We advocate that the school starts at a later time, thus more in line with the biorhythms recommended by scientists.",
    "thirdParagraph": "A few years ago there was already a vote that confirmed the time; we want to find out if there is now a majority in favor of a later school start.",
    "disclaimerOne": "A postponed start of school naturally also results in a postponed end of school. Realistically school will start at 8:00 a.m. In this case the school days end half an hour later.",
    "disclaimerTwo": "In addition, the vote is only to evaluate the opinion of the students. The school management reserves the right to decide whether and by how much the start of classes will be postponed."
